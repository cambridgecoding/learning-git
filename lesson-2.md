In order to record the changes you have made to the `lesson-1.md` files, you need to first add them to the staging area, and then to commit the staged changes.

Use the following command in a terminal:

~~~
git add lesson-1.md
~~~

Then, use the following command:

~~~
git commit
~~~

Which will ask you for a *commit message*: a short summary of your changes. You can provide a single line like “Fixing typos in lesson-1.md”.
